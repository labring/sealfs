# SEALFS
[English](https://github.com/labring/sealfs/blob/main/README.MD) | [简体
中文](https://github.com/labring/sealfs/blob/main/README-ZH.MD)

The storage system of [sealos](https://github.com/labring/sealos),
aiming to be a high-performance, highly reliable and auto-scalable
distributed file system which fits the cloud native environment.

## System Architecture

The architecture of sealfs is decentralized, and there is no single
metadata node. sealfs hopes to improve the read and write performance
as much as possible and solve the problems of storing large amounts of
small files.

### Main Components
Sealfs consists of the following three components:

#### Server

Server component is responsible for storing files and metadata. sealfs
separates data and metadata into different disks, since metadata is
undoubtedly the hot file on distributed file-system. This way, users
can choose better hardware to store metadata.

#### Client

Client component implements the file-system in user mode. It
intercepts file requests, stores, and addresses them through hash
algorithms.

#### Manager

Manager component is responsible for coordinating the cluster.


The System Architecture can be shown as follow:

### User Mode All The Way

With specific hardware, sealos hopes to support user-mode completely,
from file request hijacking on the client side, to the network, and to
the storage, for maximum performance improvement.

## RoadMap
Currently, we are committed to improving the performance
thoroughly. For other design aspects, such as high reliability and
high availability, the priority would be lower.

## Compile

```bash
cargo build
```

## Quick Start

### Mount

```bash
mkdir ~/fs
./target/debug/server &
./target/debug/client ~/fs
```

### File Operations

show directory
```bash
ll ~/fs
```
create & write file
```bash
echo "test" >> ~/fs/test.log
```

read file
```bash
cat ~/fs/test.log
```

delete file
```bash
rm ~/fs/test.log
```

make directory
```bash
mkdir ~/fs/d
```

remove directory
```bash
rm ~/fs/d
```
